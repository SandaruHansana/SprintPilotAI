# AI-Powered Human-Centric Sprint Planning Assistant (SprintPilotAI)

This project is an AI-powered web-based system designed to transform high-level project goals into optimized, actionable sprint plans, improving efficiency and decision-making in modern project management.

In many organizations, project managers struggle to convert vague or complex project objectives into well-structured sprint tasks due to time constraints, manual effort, and constantly changing project conditions. Existing project management tools often rely heavily on manual configuration or rigid automation, offering limited support for adaptability, human judgment, and hybrid project methodologies.

SprintPilotAI addresses these challenges by using natural language processing and machine learning to understand project goals written in plain language and automatically generate sprint plans with tasks, estimates, and priorities. The system supports structured human–AI collaboration, allowing project managers to review, adjust, and approve AI-generated plans while maintaining transparency and control. By learning from past project data and human feedback, SprintPilotAI enhances adaptability, improves task success prediction, and makes sprint planning more accessible, flexible, and effective for real-world project environments.
